# The Opportunity Portal

The Opportunity Portal is a comprehensive job listing and employment tracking platform that connects job seekers with potential employers. This web application provides a user-friendly interface for candidates to search and apply for jobs, while allowing employers to post job listings and manage applications.

## Technologies Used

- PHP 7.4+
- MySQL 5.7+
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Apache Web Server

## Features

- User registration and authentication for candidates and employers
- Job listing creation and management for employers
- Job search and application functionality for candidates
- Admin panel for user and job management
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/the-opportunity-portal.git
   cd the-opportunity-portal
   ```

2. Set up a local web server (e.g., Apache) and ensure PHP is installed and configured.

3. Create a MySQL database for the project.

4. Import the database schema:
   ```
   mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < database.sql
   ```

5. Copy the `config.example.php` file to `config.php` and update the database connection details:
   ```
   cp config.example.php config.php
   ```

6. Edit `config.php` and update the following variables with your database information:
   ```php
   define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
   define('DB_USER', 'your_database_username');
   define('DB_PASS', 'your_database_password');
   define('DB_NAME', 'your_database_name');
   ```

7. Ensure the `uploads` directory has write permissions for the web server:
   ```
   chmod 755 uploads
   ```

## Database Connection

The project uses a centralized database connection file (`db_connect.php`) to manage connections to the MySQL database. This file is included in all PHP scripts that require database access.

To establish a database connection in your PHP files, simply include the `db_connect.php` file:

```php
require_once 'db_connect.php';

// Use the $conn variable to interact with the database
$result = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM users");
```

## Running the Project

1. Start your local web server (e.g., Apache).

2. Open a web browser and navigate to the project's URL (e.g., `http://localhost/the-opportunity-portal`).

3. You should see the landing page with options to register or log in as a candidate or employer.

4. To access the admin panel, use the following credentials:
   - Username: admin@example.com
   - Password: admin123

   Note: Change these credentials immediately after your first login for security reasons.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of The Opportunity Portal, we encountered and overcame several challenges:

1. **User Authentication**: Implementing secure authentication for multiple user types (candidates, employers, and admins) required careful planning and execution to ensure proper access control and session management.

2. **Database Design**: Creating an efficient database schema to handle relationships between users, jobs, applications, and other entities while maintaining data integrity and optimizing query performance was challenging.

3. **File Uploads**: Implementing secure file upload functionality for resumes and company logos required careful consideration of file types, size limits, and storage management.

4. **Search Functionality**: Developing an efficient job search feature that could handle various filters and provide relevant results quickly required optimization of database queries and implementation of proper indexing.

5. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across different devices and screen sizes required careful planning and testing of the CSS and layout structure.

6. **Error Handling**: Implementing a robust error handling and logging system to manage and track issues across the application while providing user-friendly error messages was crucial for maintaining a good user experience and facilitating debugging.

7. **Security**: Addressing various security concerns, including SQL injection prevention, cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, and secure password hashing, required constant vigilance and implementation of best practices throughout the development process.
